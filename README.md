## Challenge 1 - Infrastructure as code

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is widely used in several organizations with the aim of standardizing cloud infrastructure using an approach adopted in the "development world" by managing code in a Git repository and, in addition, using automation practices, such as CI (Continuous Integration) and CD (Continuous Delivery).

Through a practical approach, the following topics will be covered:

- What is infrastructure as code
- Working with Github
- Pull-Request/Code Review
- Task management
- Azure Fundamentals
- GitActions
- Azure DevOps
- Network Fundamentals
- Final challenge

At the end of the challenge, it will be possible to work with the IaC model, from basic to advanced levels and adopt the best practices of large companies.

As a basis for this challenge, the Git Project will be used to manage learning activities, as well as other activities related to the final challenges.
